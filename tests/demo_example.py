PROBLEM_STATEMENT = """
Two Sum Problem:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9

**Complete Solution:**
```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    # Optimal approach using hash map
    num_map = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    
    return []  # No solution found

# Test cases
def test_two_sum():
    # Test case 1
    nums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target1 = 9
    result1 = two_sum(nums1, target1)
    print(f"Test 1: {result1}")  # Expected: [0, 1]
    
    # Test case 2
    nums2 = [3, 2, 4]
    target2 = 6
    result2 = two_sum(nums2, target2)
    print(f"Test 2: {result2}")  # Expected: [1, 2]

test_two_sum()
```

**Explanation:**
1. We use a hash map (dictionary) to store numbers we've seen and their indices
2. For each number, we calculate its complement (target - current number)
3. If the complement exists in our hash map, we found our pair
4. Otherwise, we store the current number and its index for future lookups

**Key Concepts:**
- Hash map for O(1) lookup time
- Single pass through the array
- Space-time tradeoff optimization

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n) - single pass through array
- Space: O(n) - hash map storage

**Learning Notes:**
- This is more efficient than the O(n¬≤) brute force approach
- Hash maps are powerful for "find complement" problems
- Always consider edge cases and test with multiple inputs
